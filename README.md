# Frontend-manual-testing
These are some of the manual testing materials I did for learning and perfecting my craft. 
They are a mixture of multiple website, platforms and etc., on multiple devices/OSs.
Here I publish all kinds of frontend manual testings I do, showcasing bugs from websites of famous, local and other platforms, as well as of international and local IT companies.
